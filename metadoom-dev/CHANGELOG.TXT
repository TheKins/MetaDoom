v1.2 "Slayer" (06/10/16)
========================
Development has been fairly slow recently, but there have been some important
and not so important changes that necessitate a proper release.

- Fixed missing change from Bloodsplat rewrite implementation, oops
- Pinky spawners are now less likely to spawn dogs unless within 512 units
  of a Possessed spawner
- Cleaned up and removed old TEXTURES-based SSG assets from before Shivers
  made it less painful to witness
- Monster spawners now pass on TID (thx Yholl!)
- Added support for Back to Saturn X to the Water Pistol
- Fixed an obit for Berserk ZDoom Marines (Thanks Techokami!)
- ZDoom Marines now drop stuff when killed (Thanks Techokami!)
- Fixed gibs and debris telefragging Voodoo Dolls, rendering TNT MAP30
  extremely difficult to complete

v.1.1 "Slayer" (22/09/16)
=========================
Some quick, but vital bug-fixes for issues raised after 1.0 was launched.

- Blood Splats are completely reprogrammed to be far less resource-intense
  (Thanks Major Cooke!)
- Dog Collar now ignores Switch on Pickup setting and makes you switch to
  the Hellhound as intended.
- Fixed Mancubus shots not generating decals.
- Fixed Cyberdemon not spawning in Doom 1. (Thanks Techokami!)

Optional Content:
- Keens no longer block the player after death.

v.1.0 "Slayer" (19/09/16)
========================
There's enough changes in this release that I feel very comfortable calling it
a first proper release instead of another tech demo! That being said: I'm still
far, FAR from done. Please keep providing feedback and if you feel you have
something to offer, you're more than welcome to let me know! Thanks for
playing my mod!

- Added 1 new weapon! (Fire Extinguisher)
- Added 2 new enemies! (Hell Razer, Phantom)
- Revamped 2 old enemies! (Hell Knight, Baron of Hell)
- Revamped the Scripted Marines that nobody uses in their maps anymore!
  (Because nobody makes ZDoom maps anymore! Sadly!)
- Added 2 new inventory items! (Siphon Grenade, Dog Collar)
- Added treasure items from the Press Release beta!
- Added low health warning!
- Added an optional addon to Meta-fy the extra MAP31/32 enemies!
- Revamped the powerup sphere sprites!

Changes to Weapons:
- Buffed the Shotgun Grenade explosion to be identical to a standard rocket.
- Re-added a cooldown to the Rocket Launcher primary fire, and made this period
  interruptable by the altfire.
- Holy Water takes twice as long to acquire (1 ammo per second)
- Holy Water now also rewarded if you're underwater
- Made the Chaingun turret firing louder
- Fixed bug where dying while using the Chaingun turret would result in the
  firing sound looping forever, mortally wounding your ears
- Fixed being unable to melee in netplay
- Buffed the Gauss Cannon's damage, but lowered its firing rate to compensate
- Added Shivers' revamped SSG sprites!
- Machinegun now takes selection precedence over chaingun

Changes to Spawners:
- Changed New Item spawning method to something lamer, so as to prevent items
  being spawned inside of walls
- Dramatically reduced spawn rate of the Shield Wall
- Doom 1 SSG spawning altered to now allow SSG alts to spawn in Doom 1
- Minor monster spawner tweak so that they look right on their first frame
  (for summon cheat, dormant actors in old maps etc.)
- Fixed a bug in the Chaingun Guy spawner code that'd cause Minigunners to spawn
  way more frequently than they should.
- Added proper spawners for Cyberdemon and Spiderdemon, allowing for future extensions

Changes to Performance:
- Added Blood fadeout timer option (meta_perf_bloodtime) for how long you want
  blood to last before fading. Default is a little over 190 seconds (or 6666 tics)
- Old Blood Fadeout option has been renamed and repurposed to force nigh-instant
  blood fadeout, as a sort of a "panic button" for low-perf situations
- Made floor blood way less framerate intense by making it cull splats that are
  within a user-defined radius of where it spawned. MAP06 no longer tanks the FPS on UV!
  
Changes to Monsters:
- Added new sounds to the Revenant and Archvile
- Fixed bug where Revenant was rewarding points twice
- Archvile spawns some blood and guts upon death because, you know...

Other Changes:
- Added proper credits for the Former Commando
- Tweaks and improvements to the HUD and associated graphics

- Re-ordered some weapons to ensure you select better weapons when using number keys.
- Added a "Potential Map-Breakers" cvar, to toggle or alter things that might
  let players or monsters go places they aren't supposed to go. You know, like
  jumping in BOOM maps. Not very useful right NOW, but in the future...


v.TD1.3 "Flynn" (18/08/16)

  (ala GBA Doom 1)

  alt-fire cocking sprites for consistency's sake

==========================
A hotfix for some last minute issues that people found in the

  help out people with 486s
