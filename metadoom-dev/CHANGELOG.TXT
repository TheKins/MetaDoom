v5.3 "Klave" (08/04/19)
=======================
Tweaks, bug-fixes and improvements in preparations for the next build of GZDoom.
And some un-improvements, but hey, it can't be helped.

Monster Changes:
- Switched most monster A_CustomMissile calls to A_SpawnProjectile, for
  general future-proofing purposes.
  
UI Changes:
- Temporarily disabled the mugshot and description on the Skill Level select
  screen - It looked buggy GZDoom 4.0.0, and the BoA usage permissions seem
  to have changed since I last checked from "don't use stuff that isn't in
  an official release yet" to "not until episode 3 is out". Alas.
- Added Nash's tooltips system to the MetaDoom Options menu!
  
Other Changes:
- Replaced the impressive (yet gross) optional-replacement hack with GZDoom's
  CheckReplacement event handler to offload all the hard stuff to proper
  engine handling, hopefully reducing bugs.
- Removed some half-working intermission functions that prevented the mod from
  starting in GZDoom 4.0.0.
- Reworded options in MetaDoom Options to make more sense and to allow for
  expansion in some vague undefined future.

v5.2 "Klave" (10/12/18)
===================
Some minor tweaks, fixes and optimisations to celebrate a less-than-minor
milestone - Happy quarter-century, Doom!

Performance Improvements:
- The Unwilling now have a toned-down gib effect, reducing the amount of debris
  generated in Arch-Vile heavy maps.
- Gibs now respect the Blood fade times CVar, mopping up your carnage and
  reducing your gratification severely. Blame the slaughtermap fans.
- Fixed certain weapons (Pistol, Unmaker, Lightning Gun, Rocket and Grenade
  Launchers) spawmming water splashes when fired in a certain partially-submerged
  position. Very specific, I know.

Visibility Improvements:
- The death animations of the Wretched, Malwraith, Cyber-Mancubus and Spiderdemon
  have been tweaked to improve visibility, with varying degrees of skill.
- The Spiderdemon has been scaled down a little bit to hopefully further
  improve visibility around its corpse while still looking imposing.
- Spiderdemon corpses now also turn slightly transparent when a player is near,
  to further reduce visibility issues.
  
Weapon Changes:
- Sped up Machinegun primary fire by exactly one tic.

v5.1 "Klave" (19/08/18)
===================
This update addresses some issues that popped up in the wake of v5's release.
Thanks to everyone who submitted bug reports and feedback!

Monster Changes:
- The custom monsters in "Doom 64 for Doom 2" are now properly replaced with
  their MetaDoom equivalents. Except for the Motherdemon... for now.
- Forgotten Ones are now more interesting: They don't collide with each other
  and have even less health than before, so they're swarm-ier.
- The Behemoth's flamethrower now creates half the GL lights, hopefully boosting
  performance on computers made out of cardboard.
- Beholder no longer visually flickers when scared by Holy Water.
- Disabled infighting between Cacodemon variants.

Weapon Changes:
- The Grenade Launcher grenades now do the same damage on impact as Rockets.
- Subtly increased radius of Grenade Launcher's gas bomb.
- Fixed Kinetic Mines getting pushed around by Rocket explosions.

Other Changes:
- Fixed an issue where Z-Sec wouldn't reward their Codex page when Potential
  Map-Breakers was disabled.
- The score in the HUD interpolates much faster.
- Minor Codex text tweaks and fixes.

v5 "Klave" (09/08/18)
=====================
It's been a while, hasn't it?

Not a vast amount of NEW things in this update, but what's there has a big
impact, and there are a lot of changes and improvements to existing content,
rounding off the sharp edges and generally making the entire mod way better.

New Stuff:
- Added 2 new inventory items! (Kinetic Mine, The... Artifact?!)

Optional Content:
- Optional Content is now built into the main mod and togglable via CVar, as
  opposed to being a seperate PK3 to load! (Thanks Matt and DrPySpy!)
- WolfSS and Commander Keen now respect the "More Actors" CVar.
- Added additional visual variety to some props...

UI Changes:
- Added DrPySpy's Codex! Hit the new keybind in the controls menu to bring up
  a high-quality new menu providing all the details on everything you've
  picked up or killed.
- Converted the HUD from SBARINFO to ZScript, allowing for greater flexibility
  and some of the new featues listed below....
- Player sounds and HUD mugshot now take the player's gender, as specified in
  the "Player Options" menu, into account! (Thanks DrPySpy!)
- Powerup timers on the HUD are now properly centered, adjusting as powerups are
  gained and lost. (Thanks DrPySpy and TheZombieKiller!)
- Difficulty select screen now has skill descriptions and mugshot. (Thanks BoA Team!)
- The 100% kills/items/secrets messages will now try not to overlap each other.
  when triggered in rapid succession (ie. MAP07). They'll now try and wait
  their turn and trigger one after the other.
- Updated HELP page to explain the Shared Grenade Ammo Pool and note the default
  keybind for the Codex.
- Updated ENDOOM to credit DrPySpy and mention Saber Interactive.

Generalized Bug Fixes:
- Fixed inventory cooldown getting stuck forever when transitioning between maps
- Fixed potential error when dying in Ultra-Nightmare in Doom Complete (WadSmoosh)
- Fixed all the harmless-but-agitating warnings in the console during startup.
- Various under-the-hood cleanups and tweaks that no sane human will notice.
- Players should no longer have their view snapped to their attacker when punched
  by other players in multiplayer.
- "You don't have any grenades!" text should no longer log globally.

Weapon Changes:
- The BFG's tendrils now properly reward kills and points to the appropriate
  player, rather than just Player 1. (Thanks DrPySpy!)
- The Lightning Gun's standard attack now has a very slight chance of causing
  enemies to flinch, as opposed to the previous zero chance.
- The Lightning Gun's stun bomb has been been given an aesthetic overhaul.
- If a script takes away the player's Pistol, they'll be given a Fist weapon so
  they can keep fighting until they get a Pistol again.
- Added a CVar to toggle spent brass and casings, for the truly performance-starved.
- Disabled spawning of Fire Axe in Deathmatch mode, since it still doesn't have
  its proper effect on other players yet.
- Holy Water Pistol's ammo acquisition FX ported from ACS to ZScript.
- Fixed a single-frame animation glitch when switching away from the Machinegun
  or Chaingun while their alternate modes were enabled.
- Fixed punching walls creating bad decals when armed with Gauss Cannon or Unmaker.
- Weapons now have brightmaps.

Item Changes:
- The Tesla Rocket will no longer fry the player who fired it if they're in the
  way. It also rewards kills and points properly, ala the BFG fix above.
- The Shield Wall's sprites have been redrawn to be less screenshot-rippy.
- The Shield Wall no longer blocks its user's own shots, elevating it to the
  dizzying new status of "actually useful"!
- Dramatically reduced effectiveness of Siphon Grenades on Cyberdemons and
  Spiderdemons, making it harder to "cheese out" those bosses.
- Hand Grenades are more enjoyable to actually use!
- Added additional skins for keycards and skull keys.
- Treasure items can now be disabled via CVar (meta_lootspawns).
- Additional polish and variety for treasure items...
- Items "thrown" out by other items (treasures, Agent Cores, etc.) now respect
  player-blocking lines, making it less likely that cool stuff will out of reach.
- Cell and Argent Core ammo pickups now have brightmaps.
- Light-Amp Visors now have new sprites.

Monster Changes:
- Spiderdemon artwork has been updated and re-rendered (Thanks DrPySpy!)
- Wretched now have new sprites rendered from the Doom 2016 model (Thanks Zaneion!)
- The Former Lieutenant now wears blue armor, to make him look less like his
  chaingun wielding siblings (DrPySpy did a lot on this update just FYI)
- Spiborgs and Bull Demons are now harder to make flinch when they're charging
  (in multiple meanings of the word), making them harder to cheese-out.
- Fixes and improvements to the logic behind Summoners spawning Unwilling.
  (Thanks Major Cooke!)
- Fiend's sprite offsets are considerably less whacky.
- Additional gibbing sound variety added.
- A_SetScale hack used for random sprite mirroring on death replaced with the
  recently-added SPRITEFLIP flag, since it's a better way of doing it.
- Imported Doom 2 Minor Sprite Fixing Project assets for the following monsters:
  Arachnotron, Arch-Vile, Mancubus, Pain Elemental and Revenant.
- Phantoms now have unique sounds.
- Pistol Scripted Marines now only do the original Doom Pistol's amount of damage,
  instead of the increased damage of the player's EKG Sidearm.
- Z-Sec now use the proper firing sound instead of the vanilla shotgun.
- Nightmare Imps now have red blood on their death animations.
- Arachnotrons and Spiborgs now properly bleed when Axe'd.
- Melee now instakills Trites. Squish!
- Additional polish and variety in WolfSS and Commander Keen replacmements...

v4.1 "Fred" (06/06/17)
======================
A number of small fixes based on feedback from the previous release. Thanks, folks!

- Fixed Zombieman spawners only spawning Hell Razers when "More Actors" is off.
- Zombiemen, Shotgun Guys and Z-Secs are now slightly less perfectly accurate.
- Sawcubi now have a 50/50 chance of dropping a chainsaw when gibbed, by popular demand.
- Summoners now have a limit on the number of times they can, well, summon, without
  any players looking, preventing cases of wayward Summoners flooding the map.
- Summoners now appear after 20 maps instead of 10.

v4 "Fred" (30/05/17)
====================
Violence has arrived! Lots of new monsters, a revamped boss, and more polish than
you can handle, including a couple of things that haven't been in any mods before
this one! I'm absurdly happy with this one, as it finally meets my original vision
for this mod when I started it a little over a year ago.

- Revamped 1 enemy (Spider Mastermind!)
- Added 7 new enemies (Behemoth, Cyber-Mancubus, Spiborg, Trite,
                       Summoner, Unwilling and the Sawcubus!)
- Added 1 powerup (Quad Damage!)

Inventory Changes:
- All inventory items now have a brief (less than a second) cooldown on usage,
  preventing "inventory spamming" strategies that blew out balance.
- Dramatically reduced AOE radius of Siphon Grenades so as to better match the
  explosion graphic.
  
Weapon Changes:
- Fixed Unmaker firing sound cutting off the altfire sound. (Thanks TerminusEst13!)
- Lightning Gun now consumes ammo at a much faster rate.
- Lightning Gun now does sliiiiightly more damage.
- Fixed several minor bugs with Lightning Gun alt-fire mechanics.
- BFG explosion sound now plays properly.
- BFG explosion now has an actual explosion involved... if that makes sense.

Monster Changes:
- Spawners now detect when you're playing Doom 1 episodes or No Rest For The Living,
  and adjust the number of maps required for variant monsters to start spawning,
  so that you can still see a good bunch of them with the lower level count.
- Fixed an obscure bug with Imp Lords that occured when they teleported away
  just after killing the player, where they would forget that gravity exists.
- Revenants and Fiends no longer infight. They are now Skelefriends. Pallingtons?
- The Bruiser Bros' jump attack's landing sound now plays properly.
- The Bruiser Bros no longer perform their jump attack when Potential Map Breakers
  are turned off.
- The Former Human family now have new sound effects.
- Adjusted Nightmare Imp sprite scaling to better match original game.
- Nightmare Spectre now uses Doom 64 sprites.

HUD Changes:
- Health gem now indicates when you're invulnerable.
- Armor gem now indicates when you have Blue Armor.
- Ammo bar is now effected by meta_pistolammo, as it should be.

Miscellaneous:
- IWAD map names have been given proper capitalization, because sure, okay.
- Exploding Barrel now has more more visible splash effects.
- Scoring 100% kills/items/secrets on a level will pop up a little message on
  the screen and award you a bunch of points. (Note: This can only be triggered
  once per category per level.)
- SP Intermission screen has been changed and now displays your current score,
  along with highlighting 100%-ed categories.
- Fixed the brief "pause" between the start and loop sounds on platforms.
- Explosive Barrels have the nice Smooth Doom idle animation now.

New CVars (also in MetaDoom Options menu):
- The "Spooky Spoders" CVar (meta_nospoders) controls whether or not Trites spawn,
  for the violently arachnophobic among you.
- The "Separate Episodic Spawn Rules" CVar (meta_episodicspawns) toggles whether
  monster spawns will use episodic progression rules (as noted above) in episodic
  maps. Turn off to force Doom 2 progression, like in previous versions of MetaDoom.
- The "100% Message Size" CVar (meta_toastsize) scales the 100% message (as noted
  above). This isn't perfect, and the message will still look best at 1x scale,
  but some people just hate big pixelly text, you know?
  
Optional Content:
- Props have now been meta-fied! The random set-dressing throughout the Doom
  world has been given a lick of paint, and now blend in better with the
  enhancements the mod makes to the monsters. Some of them are destructible!
  Some of them are even extinguishable!
- Commander Keens now have more variants, further covering Id's pre-Wolf history.

v3.666 "Samuel" (08/04/17)
==========================
Some final changes and additions before I set off to work on v4...

New Features:
- Added a "Pistol Uses Ammo" CVAR! (meta_pistolammo)
  This makes the Pistol use Clip bullets like in vanilla Doom, and will give
  you 50 bullets at the start of the first map.

Weapon Changes:
- Soulcube now requires 10 souls instead of 5
- Adjusted Chaingun turret ammo usage
- Buffed the BFG's altfire by an impressive amount

Miscellaneous:
- Menu sub-headers in MetaDoom Options menu are now gold instead of red
- Moved new keybinding strings to LANGUAGE to sate my lust for localization
- Lost Soul-family monsters no longer spawn fire when time is frozen

v3.64 "Samuel" (05/04/17)
=========================
This update adds special compatibility for my "Consolation Prize" version of
Nevander's awesome Doom 64 Retribution TC. You can now rip and tear through
Midway's corridors with 20 years of additional progress in your pocket. All
that's missing is the Mother Demon... but maybe in the future...

- The Unmaker and Demon Keys now all spawn where they did in Doom 64.
- Nightmare Imps now spawn where they did in Doom 64.
- Unmakers no longer spawn from BFG spawn points in Doom 64.
- Demon Keys now lock the portals in MAP28 of Doom 64 as intended.
- Doom 64 liquid flats now have proper terrain fx and wash out blood splats
- Doom 64 liquid flats now refill the Holy Water Pistol as intended.

v3.2 "Samuel" (01/04/17)
========================
This version primarily makes under-the-hood changes to the mod's programming
that will reduce instances of doing things "bad ways" and as a result hopefully
result in better performance in certain situations.

Special thanks to Doomed_SpaceMarine on Twitch for finding some of these issues!
Live on stream, just to multiply the embarassment of screwing up. :V

Weapon Changes:
- Reduced Chaingun turret ammo consumption... for real this time!
- Made the Lightning Gun stream look a little better from the first person
- Minor tweak to the Lightning Gun stun bomb effect

Minor Bugfixes (or as Chronoteeth would call it, Fun-Ruining):
- Fixed Nightmare Imps getting huge 'n' swole when resurrected
- Fixed Bruisers sometimes moonwalking when resurrected
- Fixed some potential issues with certain monster spawners (Mancubus, Arachnotron,
  Boss Monsters) that could cause certain scripts (for example, Doom64 MAP28) to
  not function correctly.

Monster Changes:
- Converted MonsterCore (the code all monsters inherit from & share) to ZScript
- Converted Lost Souls, Phantoms and Forgotten Ones to ZScript
  - Changed how Lost Souls and co. spawn their fire to be less messily coded.
  - Lost Souls and their ilk no longer trail fire if nobody's looking at them,
    potentially reducing lag in maps with scores of Lost Souls present.
- Flying monsters (Cacodemons, Lost Souls etc.) are no longer thrust upwards
  (and out of the player's reach) when punched. This should make it less frustrating
  for players with Berserk to fistfight Cacodemons etc.

Miscellaneous:
- Options menu now has the "MetaDoom Options" button appended to the bottom of
  it by the engine, as opposed to overwriting the entire Options Menu to add it
  to the list.
- Deathmatch now replaces the score counter on the HUD with a frag counter
- Moved the Map Stats portion of the HUD a whopping TWO pixels to the left, WOW
- Minor LANGUAGE tweaks

v3.1 "Samuel" (02/03/17)
========================
Various tweaks and improvements based on player feedback. Thanks to everyone for
their feedback! I greatly appreciate it!

- Explosive Barrels now use the old explosion animation speed when killed by
  another explosive barrel. This should make, say, DOOM2 MAP23 more forgiving.
- The "6" key now defaults to the Plasma Rifle at first if you have it.
- Added Zrrion's modified radsuit sprite!
  
Monster Tweaks:
- Hellhounds: Will now get instagibbed by the Axe, like Zombies.

Weapon Tweaks:
- Super Shotgun: Added FOV punch and tweaked animation on firing.
- Chaingun: Ammo consumption reduced in both firing modes.
- Lightning Gun: Primary fire damage and range increased.
- Lightning Gun: Altfire no longer causes bleeding.
- Plasma Rifle: Altfire projectile speed and damage increased
- Plasma Rifle: Altfire projectile causes splash damage on impact.

v3.0 "Samuel" (14/02/17)
========================
Time for another big helping of new content, vital bug fixes and unnecessary
polish. There's even some ZScript, to bring this mod kicking and screaming
into the 21st Century. I'm pretty proud of this one, all things considered.

- Added 2 new weapons (Grenade Launcher, Lightning Gun)
- Added 4 new enemies (Fiend, Former Assassin, Imp Lord, Bull Demon)
- Added 1 inventory item (Hologram)

- Added some of Capn J's sounds for Revenant
- Added a sound for when enemies are damaged by Siphon Grenades

- Fixed sprite scaling on Rocket Launcher spawns
- Fixed a bug with Cacodemon spawning logic causing Malwraths to appear early,
  and Wretcheds to probably not really show up at all. I'm good at this.
- Fixed Barons and Hell Knights damaging each other and infighting
- Fixed a bug where, when firing a Machinegun mini-rocket with exactly five bullets left,
  you'd spend the bullets and play the sound but not actually fire the projectile.
- Fixed a bug where trying to deselect weaponized Demon Dogs or Cerberuses would
  lock the player into an unarmed state.
- Fixed Unmaker altfire particle density being lower than intended
- Many bug-fixes and cosmetic improvements to the Axe's bleeding effect

- Keycards now have randomized, matching skins
- Chainsaw upthrust now does more damage and pushes enemies upwards

- Various under the hood improvements to the code, including the introduction
  of ZScript, better commenting and general tabbing clean-ups.

Optional Content:
- Scripted Marines now bleed when whacked with an Axe.

v2.11 "Olivia" (02/01/17)
=========================
A quick bugfix for a startup issue with the very latest version of GZDoom. Sorry for the inconvenience.

- Fixed a GetDistance issue that prevented startup on GZDoom 2.3.0

v2.1 "Olivia" (01/12/16)
========================
Just a quick bug-fix update before both Cacowards season and DECORATE-based mods become
an antiquated relic that will score you the derisive scorn of all for playing. What do
you MEAN you haven't shoehorned an entirely undocumented new scripting system into the
engine purely to serve your own mod and no other? I thought you were one of the cool kids...

- Firing off the SoulCube now tries to switch to the Unmaker if you have it.
- Fixed Gauss Cannon doing less damage than intended when zoomed in.
- Fixed Fire Extinguisher generating blood decals when hitting something it can't damage.
- Defined a physical height and radius for Lost Soul fire particles, potentially improving performance.
- Lowered Malwrath sprite offsets, fixing its hitbox mostly being "under" it

Optional Content:
- Fixed the Optional Content crashing at startup when playing Doom 1... even though the Optional Content
  has no effect on Doom 1. Why would you do this? Whatever, it's fixed now.
- Moved Scripted Marines to the Optional PK3 for that one guy who was playing a mod that replaced
  Scripted Marines with scenery, causing everything to go all pair-shaped.

v2.0 "Olivia" (20/11/16)
========================
And we are back! Lots of fixes, tweaks, improvements and new content this time around!
Sorry that it took so long - it's not like I have any game publishers and/or
engine developers helping me out like SOME mod projects out there...

- Added 2 new weapons! (Unmaker, SoulCube)
- Added 6 new enemies! (Demon Dog, Cerberus, Malwrath, Wretched, Beholder, Rahovart)
- Revamped the Cyberdemon with new sprites, sounds and attacks!
- Updated Hellknight sprites to Zaneion's latest version, featuring more detail!
- Pain Elementals will now bite your shit if you try to bait their hungry mouth!
- Added awesome new art for the Dog Collar, Shield Wall and Tesla Rocket! Thanks Capn J!
- Adjusted alignment on inventory icons to look a little more centered.
- Replaced stealth monsters with normal MetaDoom spawners, because stealth
  monsters suck no matter how much DUMP maps try to redeem them.
- MBF Helper Dogs are replaced with MetaDoom Hellhounds.
- Fixed Hellhounds shrinking a little sometimes when killed.
- Fixed some cut-off on one sprite of the first person death animation.
- Fixed Siphon Grenade not affecting bosses, and reduced both damage and effect.
- Changed the cheat command from "pukename umpulse #" to "impulse #".
- Re-enabled font monospacing in SBARINFO.
- Lots of tweaks and edits for pre-existing sounds.
- Fixed weapon stay/respawn in multiplayer.

Optional Content:
- Added DONTFALL flag to Keens to fix a visual bug.

v1.2 "Slayer" (06/10/16)
========================
Development has been fairly slow recently, but there have been some important
and not so important changes that necessitate a proper release.

- Fixed missing change from Bloodsplat rewrite implementation, oops
- Pinky spawners are now less likely to spawn dogs unless within 512 units
  of a Possessed spawner
- Cleaned up and removed old TEXTURES-based SSG assets from before Shivers
  made it less painful to witness
- Monster spawners now pass on TID (thx Yholl!)
- Added support for Back to Saturn X to the Water Pistol
- Fixed an obit for Berserk ZDoom Marines (Thanks Techokami!)
- ZDoom Marines now drop stuff when killed (Thanks Techokami!)
- Fixed gibs and debris telefragging Voodoo Dolls, rendering TNT MAP30
  extremely difficult to complete

v.1.1 "Slayer" (22/09/16)
=========================
Some quick, but vital bug-fixes for issues raised after 1.0 was launched.

- Blood Splats are completely reprogrammed to be far less resource-intense
  (Thanks Major Cooke!)
- Dog Collar now ignores Switch on Pickup setting and makes you switch to
  the Hellhound as intended.
- Fixed Mancubus shots not generating decals.
- Fixed Cyberdemon not spawning in Doom 1. (Thanks Techokami!)

Optional Content:
- Keens no longer block the player after death.

v.1.0 "Slayer" (19/09/16)
========================
There's enough changes in this release that I feel very comfortable calling it
a first proper release instead of another tech demo! That being said: I'm still
far, FAR from done. Please keep providing feedback and if you feel you have
something to offer, you're more than welcome to let me know! Thanks for
playing my mod!

- Added 2 new enemies! (Hell Razer, Phantom)

  interruptable by the altfire.

- Fixed bug where dying while using the Chaingun turret would result in the

Changes to Spawners:
- Changed New Item spawning method to something lamer, so as to prevent items
  being spawned inside of walls
- Dramatically reduced spawn rate of the Shield Wall

- Minor monster spawner tweak so that they look right on their first frame
  (for summon cheat, dormant actors in old maps etc.)

  way more frequently than they should.
- Added proper spawners for Cyberdemon and Spiderdemon, allowing for future extensions

Changes to Performance:
- Added Blood fadeout timer option (meta_perf_bloodtime) for how long you want
  blood to last before fading. Default is a little over 190 seconds (or 6666 tics)
- Old Blood Fadeout option has been renamed and repurposed to force nigh-instant
  blood fadeout, as a sort of a "panic button" for low-perf situations
- Made floor blood way less framerate intense by making it cull splats that are
  within a user-defined radius of where it spawned. MAP06 no longer tanks the FPS on UV!

- Reduced cooldown on melee attacks
- Many monsters now react to melee attacks in a "fairer" way

  (only awards them to player 1 right now, sorry co-op fans. debugging pointer bugs is hard af)
- Fixed Z-Sec roll not resetting when damaged by Holy Water (thanks murb)
- Made the Revenant missile both prettier and more accurate to its original behavior

=======================
Development continues! Lots of new toys and even some new friends to try them on.

- Added 2 new weapons! (Chaingun, Gauss Cannon)
- Added 2 new inventory items! (Tesla Rocket, Shield Wall)
- Added 2 new monsters! (Nightmare Imp, Former Commando)
- Original Chaingun Guy is now the Former Lieutenant.
- New sprites for the Z-Sec!
- Lowered the Nightmare Spectre's health a bunch, subtly increased his overall speed
- Cacodemons now have a fancy gib effect
- Reduced the -fast speed of Hellhounds to be more managable
- Fixed some BFG obituary stuff
- Added GLDEFs for the player
- Sped up the Plasma Rifle by a single tic. WOW.
- LANGUAGE tweaks, including proper capitalization of Doom 2 intermission texts
- Fixed a bug where collecting a Berserk while under the effects of a Berserk
  would break the entire Berserk system. Thanks to Techokami for helping diagnose!
- Re-ordered some weapons to ensure you select better weapons when using number keys.
- Added a "Potential Map-Breakers" cvar, to toggle or alter things that might
  let players or monsters go places they aren't supposed to go. You know, like
  jumping in BOOM maps. Not very useful right NOW, but in the future...


v.TD1.3 "Flynn" (18/08/16)
==========================
This should hopefully be the last hotfix for TD1 before I start cracking down
on new content.

- Completely redrew Machine Gun pickup sprite from scratch
- Added a replacement HELP screen which addresses common questions
- Fixed Lost Souls and Hellhounds generating state errors when punched hard enough
- Invulnerability Sphere now has a pickup sound and uses a blue screen tint
  (ala GBA Doom 1)
- Disabled alwayspickup on weapons by request, to see if something bad happens
  again
- Added Shivers' Shotgun cocking animation and OSJClatchford's updated Shotgun
  alt-fire cocking sprites for consistency's sake
- Added a little extra zing to the green armor pickup sound
- Added Captain J's new barrel gibs, ammo sprites and improved player head gib
  (the latter being with OSJClatchford's help). Thanks!
- Berserk Fists, the Axe and terrain splashes no longer alert enemies
- Externalized Titlemap and Ironman Death subtitles to LANGUAGE

v.TD1.2 "Flynn" (15/08/16)
=========================
More clean-up duty and other balance tweaks. This doesn't cover ALL feedback, but
it should improve things a bunch. Also: New Hellhound sprite!

- Bleeding now plays a sound effect
- Fixed the Nightmare Spectre never bleeding when hit with an Axe
- Axe kills and bleeding deaths now spawn health pinata items
- Health pinata items now stick around longer

- Non-berserk fist can no longer damage barrels

v.TD1.1 "Flynn" (14/08/16)
==========================
A hotfix for some last minute issues that people found in the
first release. Always happens, eh?

- Fixed the Hellhound refusing to stop being scared. Thanks Rapid Marine!
- Added a performance mode to fade floor blood out, which should hopefully
  help out people with 486s
- Added the missing random damage variance to Berserk punches, buffing them greatly
- Fixed Shotgun Grenades, Assault Rifle Micro Missiles, BFG and many monsters
  generating no or incorrect decals. Thanks Captain J!
- Added a trail to the Shotgun Grenades, and slightly bumped up their damage
- Fixed barrels still being partially solid after being destroyed
- Fixed all weapons being considered "dropped", making them crushable

v.TD1 "Flynn" (13/08/16)
========================
The first public release. A "proof of concept" of sorts after
the first two months of development. Some stuff is still pretty
rough, but all in all it's still a fun gameplay experience.

- All "base" weapons are replaced
- Three "alternate" weapons
- Offhand melee systems
- Berserk altered, BlurSphere replaced with haste
- Monsters have appropriate new behaviors for new things
- Three new "alternate" monsters
- One new inventory item
- Fancy fake floor decals
- First person death animations
- Probably tons of bugs!
